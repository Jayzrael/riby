               <p>In Nigeria there are over 40 million individuals that save and borrow money outside of formal financial institutions. This often takes the form of common saving vehicles such as Savings Groups, collectors and community/trade associations. These cooperatives often do not wholly participate in the banking system meaning that their access to finance is limited and the management of these vehicles is mostly manual.
