            <h1>Our Premise (#BetterTogether)</h1>
            <p>
              In Nigeria there are over 40 million individuals that save and borrow money outside of
              formal financial institutions. This often takes the form of common saving vehicles
              such as Savings Groups, collectors and community/trade associations. These
              cooperatives often do not wholly participate in the banking system meaning that their
              access to finance is limited and the management of these vehicles is mostly manual.
