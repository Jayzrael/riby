               <h2>The Role</h2>
               <p>We are seeking an ambitious, bright, forward-thinking, entrepreneurial and high-spirited intern to support our EU policy work. The intern will join a fast-paced environment as a full member of the team and work alongside other functional experts who support our goals through content, host community engagement, partnerships and media relations.

                  You will report to Airbnbâ€™s EU Policy Manager.

                  Airbnb has a remote work-from-home policy in place until 1 September 2022, which means this role can initially involve working from home; however, while we are flexible, we would prefer that the intern be based in the greater Brussels area, as in-person engagements are expected to resume in due course.
